# Introduction
A Go module proxy that:
1. Can front private repositories and supports authentication to GitHub repositories via GitHub App credentials.
1. Implements strong consistency so that `.info`, `.zip` and `.mod` always reflect the same copy of a module version across all server replicas. This is an important reliability property.
1. Uses Google Cloud Storage (see [durability and availability](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes)) to realize scalable, reliable and low maintenance storage.
1. Supports client authentication and access control (but see [#2](https://github.com/go-mod-proxy/go-mod-proxy/issues/2)).

# Strong consistency
The `.info`, `.zip` and `.mod` endpoints are strongly consistent. More formally:
1. Given a copy of a module version `<m>@<v>`: `.info`, `.zip` and `.mod` as reported by GET `<m>/v@/<v>.info`, `<m>/v@/<v>.zip` and `<m>/v@/<v>.mod` requests, respectively, reflect that copy and at no point (in the future) will GET `<m>/v@/<v>.info`, `<m>/v@/<v>.zip` and `<m>/v@/<v>.mod` requests reflect a different copy.
2. Given a module version `<m>@<v>`: if any one of `.info`, `.zip` and `.mod` as reported by GET `<m>/v@<v>.info`, `<m>/v@/<v>.zip` and `<m>/v@/<v>.mod` requests, respectively, reflect a copy of the module version then all future GET `<m>/v@/<v>.info`, `<m>/v@/<v>.zip` and `<m>/v@/<v>.mod` requests reflect that copy.

Read after list is strongly consistent (if flag `--read-after-list-is-strongly-consistent` is set):
1. If a GET `<m>/@list` request lists version `<v>` then `.info`, `.zip` and `.mod` as reported by GET `<m>/v@/<v>.info`, `<m>/v@/<v>.zip` and `<m>/v@/<v>.mod` requests immediately reflect a copy of the module version.

Similarly, list after read is strongly consistent (but list may return partial results in case of errors and list does not return pseudo-versions).

## NOTE
Strong consistency is implemented using GCS atomic object creation. Implementing other storage backends may be easier by sacrificing strong consistency. For example, Amazon S3 does not support atomic object creation, but can still be pluggged in.

# Client authentication
Supports authentication using Google Compute Engine Instance Identity Tokens. This is similar to Hashicorp Vault's GCE login: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp.html#gce-login.
Supports authentication via username/password.
Supports access control lists to configure fine grained access control on modules.
See the example configuration [config_example_clientauth.yaml](config_example_clientauth.yaml).
